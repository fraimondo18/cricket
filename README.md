Implementation of the CRicKET algorithm. We provide an example that can be built and executed under contiki-ng (https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/wiki).
The implementation can also be built and executed in a different environment: the main file is keyGenLib.c. It contains the main functions: KG_sm_A, KG_sm_B.
